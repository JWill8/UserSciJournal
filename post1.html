          <p>Money and investing, a compelling category of news for anyone with with a stake in financial markets.
            <b>Finance.yahoo.com</b> provides free, up-to-date stock quotes, news, portfolio management resrouces, historical
            stock charts and many other financial resources to an average of 50 million visitors per month. It currently
            ranks in the top 20 most visited websites in
            the Money and Investing category according to similarweb.com, making it a primary resource for people around
            the world. Given the recent stock
            market news I thought this was a topical domain to review. I'm sure Americans with 401k's have been glued to
            sites like these for the last few weeks</p>

          <p>To evaluate the usability of this site, I will use the following criteria:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use of conventional Design Elements. Do the element of this site look like theyre "supposed" to?</li>
            <li>Signal to Noise ratio. How cluttered is the layout, how much "noise" does a user have to
              sift through to access the relevent content?</li>
            <li>Are Links obvious and clickable? In other words, is navigation within the site easy for the user without too much thought </li>
            <li>Scannability: Is the page broken into clearly defined areas and is the user able to quickly determine
              its content?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>First, lets take a look at finance.yahoo.com on April 12th</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-6 mx-auto">
          <img class="fluid" src="img/homepage.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
          <h2 class="section-heading">First Impression</h2>
          <p>Ads, ads and more ads. Extremely busy with many animated ads creating distraction and slowing the load
            speed. The large banner ad
            occupies
            40% of the screen! Secondly, one of the primary functions of this page is for the user to obtain stock
            quotes.
            The user would naturally be scanning for an input search bar, there is one located directly center-top, with
            the light-grey suggested text "search for news, symbols or companies", however the correct way to find stock
            quotes is to enter the ticker symbol in the search field in the lower-right portion of the screen (both
            search
            bars are circled in green) </p>

          <p>Additionally, more ads are interspersed with real articles creating the impression of the ad being content.
            But how does this site measure up using the defined critria above?</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Criteria 1: Use of Conventional Design Elements</h2>

          <p>This website follows conventional design in several ways. The
            search bars are accompanied by magnifying glass images, which users interpret to mean "search". In the head,
            a link to email is seen with the conventional envelope logo. Users can scroll through front page index
            quotes using blue left/right arrows, again, consistent with convention. The link to customize the quotes a
            user would see on the front page upon logging in is accompanied by the "gear" logo, typically associated
            with "settings". </p>

          <p>Overall, finance.yahoo.com stays consistent with design conventions that a user would be expecting to see.
            <b>Score: 5/5</b>
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Criteria 2: Noise and Clutter</h2>

          <p>Continuing with the comments from our first impressions, finance.yahoo.com is extremely cluttered by ads
            and is designed to make it difficult for the user to distinguish between ads and content. The legitimate
            content contain eye-catching headlines using "big" and "biggest ever" and "sell immediately". To some
            extent, finance.yahoo.com is a clickbait site, however it does have useful content for many people. For
            those persons looking for earnings reports, charts, and financial data for companies, they are subject to a
            tremendous amount of noise.
          </p>

          <p>Generally speaking, this is a cluttered website with a significant portion of the viewport dedicated to ads
            and clickbait a low signal to noise ratio. User experience could be improved by reducing animated ads and
            allocating less screen space to non-value added content. <b>Score: 1/5</b> with 1 point being awarded because
            the need for
            ads to
            provide free content allows for some forgiveness.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Criteria 3: Links and Navigation</h2>

          <p>Items that are clickable are obviously so, such as the S&P, Dow, Russell index quotes a well as
            cryptocurrency quotes in the bottom right. All are in light blue text which users typically understand to
            mean "this is a link". Navigation links in the header are also a shade of blue, communicating "link". When
            hovering over content, the headlines become light blue, giving confirmation that the user is interacting
            with a link.</p>

          <p>The links and navigation on this site are obvious. What's clickable is obviously clickable, things that will
            navigate the user around the site are distinguishable and follow convention without any thought. <b>Score:
              5/5</b></p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Criteria 4: Scannability</h2>

          <p>Within a few seconds, a user can see and distinguish between several headlines. The chief content types,
            Price Quotes and Articles, are visually separated allowing the user to quickly separate the two, with
            susbsets of each category also being easily separated. A user could learn how stocks were generally
            performing within 2-3 seconds of loading the page and see an array of relevent articles. The article
            headlines and preview text are easy to digest, making it easy for the user to determine if its a topic of
            interest. </p>

          <p>Overall, a user is able to distinguish between articles and quotations and can make apporpriate navigation
            choices in a few seconds. <b>Score: 5/5</b></p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Summary</h2>
          <p>While finance.yahoo.com dedicates much of its space to advertisments, setting that aside it stil provides
            useful content that a user can navigate to without thinking too much. I cant fault them too much for the
            ads, their financial records for each comapny are free of charge and recreating the same summaries would
            take me atleast 30 minutes. Clutter is really the only fault I find, overall its easy to distinguish between
            content types and to navigate the site</p>
