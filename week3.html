          <p>This week, we will be reviewing the findings from user tests of the website <a
              href="https://www.hurricanegolf.com/" target="_blank">hurricanegolf.com</a>, an online discount golf
            supply business.
          </p>
          <p>The script used for these user tests can be found <a href="testscript.html" target="_blank">here</a></p>

          <p>In this test, we will ask the user the following</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Home Page impressions: specifically what is the user able to determine about the business from the home
              page</li>
            <li>To learn about the company's return policy, asked ot assess a specific type of return</li>
            <li>To learn how to track an order
            </li>
            <li>To find a specific product</li>

          </ul>


          <p>A quick overview of the users being tested. All three are familiar with golf, have knowledge of the
            terminology and have shopped online in for products before, however have not shopped for golf products
            online in the past. All are regular computer users both at work and at home. </p>

          <H2 class="section-heading">Task 1: Home Page Assessment</h2>
          <p>Upon viewing the home page, users were able to determine that this business sells golf equipment online,
            and associated it with being a "discount" seller. One user determined that hurricane golf also offers golf
            travel packages, which is less prominently displayed. For reference, the home page is pictured below.</p>

          <p>One user correctly identified the function of the business, but later wondered if the company was a golf
            shoe/apparel company based on the most prominent ads and brands being shoe related, but concluded it was indeed selling all
            golf supplies.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/hurricanehome.png" alt="huricane golf home page">

          <p>Based on this user testing, Hurricanegolf.com's home page effectively communicates the business's market
            and niche, however some product offerings are not immediately obvious.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Task 2: Return Policy</h2>

          <p>Users were asked to use the website to determine if a fictitious order from hurricanegolf.com could be
            returned given the conditions. This information is located in the footer of the home page, pictured below:
          </p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/returns.png" alt="return information">

          <p>All users were able to locate this information eventually, however two users' initial instict was to call
            phone numbers listed on the home page which were designed to provide customer support during the COVID-19
            shutdown. This was confusing to users because the phone number is prominently listed top-center of the page
            with text inciting the user to call with questions.</p>
          <p>All users initially attempted to click menu headings instead of the links below them, indicating
            insufficient style distinction between headings and clickable links. Referencing the above picture, it can
            be seen
            that headings and listings are not separated.</p>



          <p>In all cases, users found the information within 3 minutes, however all users also attempted to click
            non-clickable menu headings prior to selecting the right page. The testing suggests this is an area for
            improvement, perhaps created better visual separation between the footer categories and more clearly
            distinguishing
            clickable links from headings.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Task 3: Track an order
          </h2>

          <p>For this task, users were asked to learn how to track an order. Information on how to do this is found once
            again in the footer under the "shipping information" link. As with the returns question, two users attempted
            to interact with unclickable menu headings before selecting the correct link. A third user did not locate
            this information, but rather went through the "my account" section of the site, which displays this:.
          </p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/myaccount.png" alt="image of my account page">

          <p>Seeing that "tracking information" is listed below "create an account" the user believed that you could not
            track an order without creating an account.</p>

          <p>Generally speaking, users were able to find out how to track an order, and in real life the user would have
            recieved an email with tracking information, however these emails cannot be relied upon as they are often
            filtered out as spam. Hurricanegolf.com does not prominently display "track an order" as many other
            e-commerce sites do and while 2 out of 3 users successfully identified that a tracking email would have been
            sent to them, one did not. A recommendation for improvement would be the ability to enter an order number
            and recieve tracking through the web and not solely relying on a UPS tracking email.</p>


          <h2 class="section-heading">Task 4: Shop for specific product</h2>

          <p>Users were asked to locate all left handed irons for sale, which would require navigating to the "irons" page
            and filtering for left handed products only. For reference, irons are located under the "golf clubs" menu on
            the home page, pictured below:</p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/menuirons.png" alt="golf clubs menu">
          <br>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/ironspage.png" alt="page displaying all irons for sale">

          <p>The three users had three different results. One user was unsuccessful and ultimately used the search bar.
            This user was distracted by the "popular searches" section of the home page and did not instinctively return
            to the top level menu of the page. </p>
          <p>The second user did utilize the top level menu, however selected the
            incorrect category first. This user eventually did locate the irons menu and successfully filtered for left
            handed products only, only after several minutes spent in incorrect sections of the site.</p>

          <p>The third user did not have difficulty with this task and completed it in under 20 seconds.</p>

          <p>Upon arriving at the "irons" page, all three users first attempted
            to use the "sort" dropdown menu to filter for left handed products. I believe this
            happened because the first sort option the user sees is "position" and users may have initially believed
            that "position" meant "left handed or right handed" in
            golf terminology. It was not clear to the users or the test facilator what "position" actually meant.</p>


          <p>Summarizing, searching for products on hurricanegolf.com follows typical conventions common to e-commerce,
            however the page
            contains distractions which sidetracked users. Users did not universally, by instinct, attempt to search by
            beginning at the top level menu especially after believing that the "popular
            searches" section, was the correct avenue for searching. Adding to the confusion is that the "popular
            searches" section uses similar/identical terminology to the top level menu, which tells the user that those
            navigation
            tools may be the same thing and therefore its unnecessary to return to the top to begin your search.</p>

          <p>Additionally, the search function did not produce
            any relevent results, so even as a last resort this was not useful. However its worth noting that a design
            element that contributed to 
            <i>successful</i> navigation was mouse-over notes, which guided all users when clicking links. These notes
            help prevent sidetracking on multiple instances.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Summary</h2>

          <p>On net, users were generally able to interact with hurricanegolf.com successfully, but this was not
            universal. All test subjects are familiar with online shopping could have been expected to adapt to any
            online shopping enviornment easily. A primary source of distraction is the "popular searches section". It
            may be useful to more clearly indicate what the top level menu allows the user to do, such as by adding "I
            want to shop for..." wording, or something to indicate that this is where shoppers should begin their
            search.</p>
