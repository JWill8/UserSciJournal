          <H2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
          <p>This week we begin to discuss Google Analytics and its role in web design. This online journal has been
            tracking user data since the first week and for the purpose of this assignment and future analytics
            assignments, we will use this blog and the associated analytics data. The reason I am choosing this site is
            because at the moment, out of the sites I own, it is generating the most traffic via student users and
            classmates.</p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Adding Google Analytics</h2>
          <p>The process for adding analytics tracking to a site that you have coded yourself is quite easy. Begin by
            signing up
            for an analytics account, if you have a gmail account already you can use this for google analytics. <a
              href="https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin/signinchooser?service=analytics&passive=1209600&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.google.com%2Fanalytics%2Fweb%2F%23&followup=https%3A%2F%2Fanalytics.google.com%2Fanalytics%2Fweb%2F&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=ServiceLogin">The
              Link for signing up for an analytics account is here</a> Google will then prompt you to define the
            "property" that you'd like to begin tracking data for, this is the URL to your page. Google will provide a
            snippet of code wiht a uniqe identifier for you to insert in to the head of every page you wish to track.
            After that, youre done. </p>


          <H2 class="section-heading">Google Analytics - Pre Evaluation</h2>
          <br>
          <h3>Demographics</h3>
          <p>Before looking into demographics data collected, I would hypothesize that the typical profile of a user of
            this online journal would be age 25 to 40, a 50/50 mix of male to female, English speaking located in
            Seattle.

          </p>
          <h3>Acquisitions</h3>
          <p>It would be very surpising to see any user visit this site by means other than direct linking! If somehow
            this journal appeared in an organic search AND was clicked and reviewed by a visitor it would be quite the
            event!</p>
          <p>Considering that searching google for the exact title and domain of this blog does not result in any
            results, I expect to find that all users were acquired by means of direct access, either clicking a link or
            typing in the URL.</p>

          <h3>User Access Methods</h3>
          <p>Access methods meaning Browser, Device type and screen size. My initial expectation is that Chrome,
            followed by Safari will be
            the most popular browsers used by visitors to this blog. I would expect the visitors to be accessing the
            site via desktops, likely a laptop with a screen size of 1300x700 pixels</p>
          <p>The rationale for these hypotheses are that Chrome is the most popular browser for desktops, and Safari
            for Mobile. I believe most visitors will be using a laptop, since the majority of visitors will be
            students in a User Science Class who are coding their own sites on a laptop. The screen size estimate is
            an average 14 inch laptop screen size.</p>


          <H2 class="section-heading">Initial Findings compared to Assumptions</h2>
          <p>We are able to use the previous 7 weeks of data to evaluate these initial assumptions, much of the
            findings are in line with expectations, however one or two were not</p>
          <h3>Demographics</h3>
          <p>Unfortunately, it does not appear the site has generated enough traffic to begin collecting demographics
            data. I believe this is due to google attempting to protect privacy by not reporting demographics until a
            large enough traffic volume can anonymize users. Unfortunately I cannot validate the demographics of the
            users here.</p>

          <h3>Acquisitions</h3>
          <p>In line with expectations, we find that traffic is acquired by direct input, likely by clicking links
            provided in
            class discussions and assignment submittals. No organic search traffic just yet!</p>

          <h3>User Access</h3>
          <p>Google Analytics has indicated that the most common browser is indeed chrome, with Safari being second.
            There is a roughly even split between mobile an desktop users. Regarding screen resolution, what's been
            observed is that there are several rather large monitors being used to view this site. The mobile
            dimensions are in line with expectations for mobile devices. Its possible a third tier of media query
            could be appropriate for these users.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Summary</h2>
          <p>Setting up analytics was quick and painless and we have confirmed that google is actively collecting
            user data for visitors of this blog. This is an incredibly powerful tool for web developers that future
            weeks will discuss in greather detail.</p>
